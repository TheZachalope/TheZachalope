Managing it is rather difficult at times with the two kids. They just turned 1 and 2 years old, which is awesome to think about, but crazy at the same time. They've both been going through sleep regressions at the same time, which means I'm not sleeping. So sleep deprivation is nearly every day. On top of financial stress. And clutter. We have a lot of things to sort through, get rid of, and organise.<br/><br/>But we're figuring it out. <span id="ipmvff">Slowly, but surely.</span> After all, that's what life is all about. Figuring it out. But you'll never truly figure everything out, so what you're really trying to figure out is how to manage knowing you're never truly have it figured out.<br/><br/>Anyhow, that's sort of why this blog exists. To be an outlet. Send my thoughts and updates out to the abyss, where anyone can read. It is somewhat comforting, thought I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>As life goes on, ideally this website will expand. Evolve. Maybe I'll learn enough to get off the free website builder Mobirise. By the way, I know the hamburger menu on mobile does not work. I don't know enough to troubleshoot it properly, yet. Maybe if I tried making it from scratch, instead of imported from Mobirise. I might try that sometime when I have the time...<br/><br/>If anyone ends up reading this, I hope you're having a good day. And if you're not, hang in there. You're not alone. Life is chaos at times, but that doesn't mean it will always be. <span id="iwohwz">That goes for me, too.</span><br/><br/>Until next time,<br/>Zach</div></div><div id="ioparw"><div id="in1ej2">Patreon? Why not</div><div id="imdwrr">January 22nd 2025<br/></div><div id="isz4n1">For some reason, I decided to make a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/zachalope" id="izepih">Patreon</a>. If someone out there is looking at this website, do you want to supply me a coffee or two a month? My only tier is $5. If someone is silly enough to do that, message me. I'll figure out something for you.<br/><br/>In other news, I have a Dell Rugged 5414 I got from eBay for $150. Integrated graphics, so it can't do much... But it runs Need for Speed Carbon and Halo: Combat Evolved really well! If you have recommendations for low end games, let me know. I'll probably play them on my lunch break at work once, maybe twice a week.<br/><br/>I'm currently reading the Throne of Glass series due to a friend recommending it. It's not something I'd normally read, but it's pretty good. I'm just now branching out of reading Stephen King's books pretty much exclusively. Due to lack of time, it takes a long time for me to actually finish a book. But hey, at least I'm reading.<br/><br/><br/><span id="iuite4">Seriously, if any of you subscribe to my Patreon, I'll figure out something after a bit of confusion.  </span></div></div><div id="inekq8"><div id="iij7lg">Figuring out the website<br/></div><div id="iao3gh">January 9th 2025<br/></div><div id="imoafw">After updating the website a few times, all the links were broken briefly. This was due to renaming the pages' filenames and for some reason Mobirise (the offline sitebuilder I use) was not updating the filenames in the coding (ie: page1.html to Blog.html).<br/><br/>I'll have to keep an eye on this and may have to update the coding before uploading from Mobirise each time until it hopefully clicks with the new names. A minor inconvenience as there are only 3 pages to update this on.<br/><br/>Still unsure about the format of this blog or the contents I'll put in it, but for now, this is what you get. <br/><br/>Oh, in other news, my wife has signed a contract with a local antique mall to have a booth inside it to sell her wares. This is exciting as every time we've had a pop-up shop or were at a farmer's market, people asked if she was anywhere local, so now we will be able to say yes! </div></div><div id="im2ia8"><div id="invsx">Home Again</div><div id="ivr0y">January 4th 2025<br/></div><div id="i50tkt">In the past week, I've ventured from Arkansas to Pennsylvania to visit my wife's grandma, who just turned 100.<br/><br/>It actually went better than expected, given it was 16+ hours on the road with two under two. Part of the reason it went so well was we brought a friend, who sat in the back where the kids could see her the entire trip pretty much.<br/><br/>My wife just signed up for space inside an antique market to sell her skincare things in person all the time, instead of only online or at event we're manning... So that's exciting. We set up in 2 weeks. Maybe this year I'll get a laser engraver and be able to assist with some branded merchandise as well as just have fun with it.<br/><br/>In the future, I might expand on things, but for now, this is a test blog. Can't believe it's already 2025 and my kids are turning 1 and 2 in February... So much to do, so little time.</div></div><div id="imj8ji"><div id="ija0a2"><span id="i70x3p">Just...
