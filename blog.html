                <p>
                  Well, it's officially 2026. My kids have been having a rough time going to sleep for some reason and then my wife was sick for the days around New Year's. So I was just up alone until a bit after midnight, not really doing anything. Our youngest puppy started having seizures, but the vet said she had high levels of onion or garlic in the tests, so we think she's been eating the wild onion that grows in the back yard... I'll have to start pulling that when cleaning up dog poop back there. My wife and I had a rough day a few days ago as we still are tryin to learn each other's triggers and ho to de-escalate, but such is life. I love her. Financially, I'm not sure how we're ging to make it until we can move out to the other property... I worry. Trying to trust God is hard.
                  <br>And now, to top off the start, one of my aunts is in critical condition after being in a bad accident yesterday. Several broken bones, internal bleeding, etc. So please pray for her.
                  <br><br>So yeah, not a great start to the year... 
                  <br><br>But, I'm trying not to lose hope. My girls are happy, they love playing outside. Yesterday, my youngest was pushing my oldest in one of those walking cars around the yard. They were both smiling and laughing so hard. It was wonderful to see.
                  <br>My wife and I were laughing together some recently, too, despite the sickness and chaos.
                  <br>And I've started to read again. Currently I'm reading <em>Hold Me Tight</em> by Dr. Sue Johnson. I'm about halfway through and and it is helping me understand things better. So far it's a great read. Now I just need to learn to implement the stuff talked about.
                  <br><br>This year will be a big year in any case. People may be moving around/leaving the job, which will be stressful, but could be interesting. My mom is retiring from her job and is going to focus on their little homestead. My girls are turning 2 and 3. And we should be moving out to the propertly near my parents in the later part of the year. 
                  <br>I'm really looking forward to the move, despite the 15+ minute longer commute.
                  <br><br>Anwway, yeah... rough start to the year. It's Saturday and I'm working due to the recent sicknesses not letting me come in on Friday. 
                  <br><br>In other news, we recently got Disney's Dreamlight Valley and my wife is enjoying it. She's been playing it quite a bit lately and my girls enjoy watching and seeing the familiar characters. It'll be really fun when they're able to actually play things with us. Currently, they just hold controllers that don't have batteries and pretend. But once they understand the concept of games, we'll let them in on the Mario Party sessions and teach then simple board games. I'm more excited about the board games, really. I hope our girls grow into loving board games. 
                  <br><br>My parents got the girls this blue Jeep car they can both ride in. They can control it, but it also have a remote controller so we can drive it for them. They were loving driving around in my parents' yard and up their driveway. The laughter and smiles are always the best. It'll stay out there since we don't really have the space to store such a thing, but they're out there most weekends, so it'll be good still.
                  <br><br>Well that's the update starting the New Year. I hope you all had a good 2025 and kicked off 2026 strong. Until next time!
